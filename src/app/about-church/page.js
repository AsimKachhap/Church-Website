        The seeds of divine vision were sown in 1982, whe Sanjo CMI Bhavan was
        established at Patel Nagar, Ghaziabad. The Mariam Nagar Complex, as we
        know today, was born from the sacred vision of Rev. Fr. Gerald
        Pandinjarepeedika CMI. Guided by God's providence, this dremn began to
        take form in 1989 when a new campus was established and blessed in
        Mariam Nagar.

        Years earlier in 1979, Fr. Amadeus OFM had founded a school under the
        management of Sacred Heart Church, Patel Nagar. Responding to divine
        call, the CMI Fathers were invited to take over the school, which was
        renamed St. Joseph's Academy in the year 1982-83. The St. Joseph's
        Academy was relocated to Mariam Nagar on July 16, 1989, marking a new
        chapter in the mission of Catholic educationin the region.

        In the fullness of God's time, St. Mary's Assumption Church was
        officially erected as Parish on 15th August 2007, a date filled with
        Marian significance. The declaration was made by His Excellency Bishop
        Patric Nair of the Meerut Diocese, and the pastoral care of the Parish
        was entrusted to the Carmelities of Mary Immaculate, St. John's
        Provience, Bijnor.

        It remains the previlae of the Provincial to recommend the name of the
        Parish Priest, whom the Bishop then appoints with the necessary
        ecclesiastical faculties. THe CMI Fathers, with their charism of
        service, minister to all Catholics in the area, irrespective of their
        rite - be it Latin or Syro-Malabar - celebrating the liturgy in ways
        meaningful to each community.

        The land of the church are under the jurisdiction of the Meerut Diocese,
        ensuring the spiritual nourishment is deeply rooted in diocesan
        tradition and guidance.{" "}
